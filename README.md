### 🧠 About Me

I'm a former **Area Manager** at Owndays Vietnam (Japanese eyewear brand), where I managed multiple stores across the Northern region and achieved operational milestones like:

- 📈 Boosted per-employee sales by 15% through KPI tracking tools in Excel  
- 🧾 Reduced warranty costs by 20% with data-backed product feedback systems  
- 👓 Earned an **Optician certificate** to serve customers with professionalism and care

These hands-on achievements inspired me to pursue **Data Analytics**, combining my operational knowledge with tools like:

- `Python` (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- `SQL` (Google BigQuery)  
- `Power BI`, `Excel`, `Notion`  
- RFM Segmentation, Churn Prediction, Business Dashboards
